Note that you may need to ESL flag plugins from the standard LS list and from any additions made in order for anything to function. The easy guide on how to do that is [here](https://tes5edit.github.io/docs/8-managing-mod-files.html#ESLifyingPluginstheeasyway).

You will NOT be able to add EVERY SINGLE MOD HERE. The non-ESL limit for plugins is still 254, so you might have to choose some to get rid of if you want to include others. Depending on what you remove, you'll also have to patch accordingly (I try to treat LS as "one mod" for patching, so it's usually fine to follow instructions if the versions match, but make sure to check in SSEEdit)
