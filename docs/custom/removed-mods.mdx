### Not So Fast - Main Quest

* Disable `NotSoFast-MainQuest.esp` and `BCS_NotSoFast_Patch.esp` from the plugins. Confirm that there are no alerts from other plugins, then you can disable the mod "Not So Fast - Main Quest"

### Not So Fast - Mage Guild

* Disable `NotSoFast-MageGuild.esp` from the plugins. Confirm that there are no alerts from other plugins, then you can disable the mod "Not So Fast - Mage Guild"
